## Birthweight regression study

-- Data:  collect gestational age, gender, and birthweight from 24 babies

-- Data loaded from LearnBayes package

-- Interested in relationship between gestational age and birthweight

-- Want to predict birthweight given particular values of gestational age

## Load data

```{r}
library(LearnBayes)
head(birthweight)
```

## Regression model

-- (Sampling) Heights $y_1, ..., y_n$ are independent

$$y_j \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_j, \sigma)$$

-- (Prior) $$(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma) \sim g()$$

-- Think of weakly informative choice for $g$


## Standardizing covariate and response

-- Helpful to standardize both response and covariate

$$y^*_j = \frac{y_j - \bar y}{s_y}$$ 
$$x^*_j = \frac{x_j - \bar x} {s_x}$$

-- Helps in thinking about prior and interpretion

-- mean $E(y^*_j) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^*_j$

## Choosing a prior

-- What information would one have about regression?

-- $\beta_0$ will be close to 0 

-- $\beta_1$ represents correlation between covariate and response

-- certainly think $\beta_1 > 0$

## Using LearnBayes package

-- Write a function to compute the logarithm of the posterior

Arguments are 

-- parameter vector

$\theta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \log \sigma)$ 

-- data (data frame with variables `s_age` and `s_weight`)

## Expression for posterior

- Likelihood is
$$
L(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma) = \prod f_N(y_j; \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_j, \sigma)
$$
- Posterior is proportional to
$$
L(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma) g(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma)
$$
where $g()$ is my prior

## Write function to compute log posterior

-- Here my prior on $(\beta_0, \beta_1, \log \sigma)$ is uniform (why?)

```{r}
birthweight$s_age <- scale(birthweight$age)
birthweight$s_weight <- scale(birthweight$weight)
logpost <- function(theta, data){
  a <- theta[1]
  b <- theta[2]
  sigma <- exp(theta[3])
  sum(dnorm(data$s_weight, 
            mean = a + b * data$s_age, 
                         sd = sigma, log=TRUE))
}
```

## Obtaining the posterior mode (LearnBayes)

-- The `laplace` function in `LearnBayes` finds the posterior mode

-- Inputs are `logpost`, starting guess at mode, and data

```{r}
laplace(logpost, c(0, 0, 0), birthweight)$mode
```

## Using rethinking package

-- Write description of model by a short script 

```{r}
library(rethinking)

flist <- alist(
  s_weight ~ dnorm( mu, sigma ) ,
  mu <- a + b * s_age ,
  a ~ dnorm( 0, 10) ,
  b ~ dnorm(0, 10) ,
  sigma ~ dunif( 0, 20)
)
```

## Find the normal approximation to posterior

-- `map` function in `rethinking` package

-- `precis` function finds the posterior means, standard deviations, and quantiles

```{r}
m3 <- rethinking::map(flist, data=birthweight)
precis(m3)
```

## Extract simulated draws from normal approximation

-- `map` function in `rethinking` package

```{r}
post <- extract.samples(m3)
head(post)
```

## Show 10 simulated fits of $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(birthweight, aes(s_age, s_weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(data=post[1:10, ], 
              aes(intercept=a, slope=b))
```

## Posterior of E(y)

-- Suppose you want the posterior for expected response for a specific covariate value

-- Posterior of $h(\beta) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 s_{age}$ for specific value of `s_age`

-- Just compute this function for each simulated vector from the posterior

## Posterior of E(y)

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2.5}
s_age <- 1
mean_response <- post[, "a"] + s_age * post[, "b"]
ggplot(data.frame(mean_response), aes(mean_response)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) +
  geom_density(color="red")
```

## Prediction

-- Interested in learning about future weight of babies of particular gestational age

-- Relevant distribution $f(y_{new} | y)$

-- Simulate by (1) simulating values of $\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma$ from posterior and (2) simulating value of $y_{new}$ from (normal) sampling model

-- In `rethinking` package, use function `sim`

## Illustrate prediction 

- Define a data frame of values of `s_age`

- Use `sim` function with inputs model fit and data frame

```{r}
data_new <- data.frame(s_age = c(-1, 0, 1))
pred <- sim(m3, data_new)
```

## Prediction intervals

- Output of `sim` is matrix of simulated predictions, each column corresponds to one covariate value

- Summarize this matrix using `apply` and `quantile` to obtain 80% prediction intervals

```{r}
apply(pred, 2, quantile, c(.1, .9))
```

## Exercises

Suppose you collect the weight and mileage for a group of 2016 model cars.

Interested in fitting the model
$$
y_i \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i, \sigma)
$$
where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are standardized weights and mileages

1.  Construct a reasonable weakly informative prior on $(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma)$

2.  Suppose you are concerned that your prior is too informative in that the posterior is heavily influenced by the prior. What could you try to address this concern?

3.  Describe a general strategy for simulating from the posterior of all parameters

## Exercises (continued)

4.  Suppose one is interested in two problems: (P1) estimating the mean mileage of cars of average weight and (P2) learning about the actual mileage of a car of average weight.  What are the relevant distributions for addressing problems (P1) and (P2)?

5.  For some reason, suppose you are interested in obtaining a 90% interval estimate for the standardized slope $\beta_1 / \sigma$.  How would you do this based on simulating a sample from the joing posterior?
