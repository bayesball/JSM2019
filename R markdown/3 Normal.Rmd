## A Gaussian Model of Height (Chapter 4 from Rethinking Statistics)

-- Data:  partial census data for the Dobe area !Kung San

-- Load from rethinking package

-- Interested in modeling heights of individuals 18 and over

```{r}
library(rethinking)
data(Howell1)
d2 <- Howell1[Howell1$age >= 18, ]
```

## Bayesian Model

### Normal Sampling 

-- Heights $h_i \sim$ Normal($\mu, \sigma$)

### Prior 

-- $(\mu, \sigma) \sim g_1(\mu) g_2(\sigma)$


### Questions about prior:

-- What does it mean for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to be independent?

-- How does one specify priors for $\mu$, and for $\sigma$?

## Specifying Prior

-- Beliefs about $\mu$ are independent of beliefs about $\sigma$

-- Author chooses vague prior for $\mu$ with mean equal to his height (cm), and large standard deviation (include a large range of plausible mean heights)

-- Likewise choose vague prior for $\sigma$ to allow for large or small spreads of individual heights

-- $\mu \sim N(178, 20), \sigma \sim N(0, 50)$

## This Prior Implies a Distribution for Heights

-- Prior predictive density of heights

$$f(h) = \int f(h | \mu, \sigma) g(\mu, \sigma) d\mu d\sigma$$
-- Sumulate heights from this distribution by ...

-- (1) simulate 1000 values from prior of $(\mu, \sigma)$

-- (2) simulate 1000 heights using these random parameters


## Simulation of Heights

- "expected distribution of heights, averaged over the prior"

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2.5}
sample_mu <- rnorm(1000, 170, 20)
sample_sigma <- runif(1000, 0, 50)
prior_h <- rnorm(1000, sample_mu, sample_sigma)
dens(prior_h)
```

## Posterior

-- Collect heights from 352 adults

-- Posterior is given by "Prior times Likelihood" recipe

$$
g(\mu, \sigma | data) \propto g(\mu, \sigma) L(\mu, \sigma)
$$

-- Likelihood is sampling density of heights, viewed as a function of the parameters

$$
L(\mu, \sigma) =  \prod N(y_i; \mu, \sigma)
$$

## Summarizing the Posterior -- Some Basic Strategies

-- **Grid Approximation**  One computes values of the posterior over a large grid of values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

-- **Quadratic Approximation**  Find the posterior mode and use this to approximate the posterior by a multivariate normal distribution

-- **MCMC** Simulate from the posterior using a MCMC algorithm (Metropolis, Gibbs sampling, Stan)

## Illustrate Grid Approximation

-- In `LearnBayes` package, write function to compute the log posterior of ($\mu, \log \sigma$)

```{r}
require(LearnBayes)
lpost <- function(parameters, y){
  mu <- parameters[1]
  sigma <- parameters[2]
  log_likelihood <- sum(dnorm(y, mu, sigma, log=TRUE))
  log_prior <- dnorm(mu, 178, 20, log=TRUE) +
               dunif(sigma, 0, 50, log=TRUE )
  log_likelihood + log_prior
}
```

## Compute Posterior Over a Grid

-- function `mycontour` produces contours over exact posterior density

```{r}
mycontour(lpost, c(152, 157, 6.5, 9), d2$height)
```

## Quadratic Approximation

-- In `resampling` package, write some R code that defines the model

```{r}
flist <- alist(
  height ~ dnorm( mu, sigma ) ,
  mu ~ dnorm( 178, 20 ) ,
  sigma ~ dunif( 0, 50)
)
```

- Fit model using `map` function

```{r}
m4.1 <- map( flist, data = d2)
```

## Normal Approximation

- Posterior of $(\mu, \sigma)$ is approximately bivariate normal

- Extract mean and standard deviations of each parameter by `precis` function

```{r}
precis( m4.1 )
```

## Interpret

- We have Bayesian interval estimates for each parameter

- $P(153.95 < \mu < 155.27) \approx 0.89$

- $P(7.27 < \sigma < 8.20) \approx 0.89$

- Why 89 percent intervals?

## What Impact Does the Prior Have?

- Try different choices for prior and see impact on the posterior intervals

- Author tries a N(178, 0.1) prior for $\mu$ -- do you think this make a difference in the posterior?

- Here we have a lot of data, so ...

## Different Prior

- Applying a precise prior on $\mu$ -- does it make a difference?

```{r}
m4.2 <- map(flist <- alist(
  height ~ dnorm( mu, sigma ) ,
  mu ~ dnorm( 178, 0.1 ) ,
  sigma ~ dunif( 0, 50)
  ), data=d2
)
precis(m4.2)
```

## Sampling from the Posterior

-- If we use quadratic approximation, then posterior will be (approximately) multivariate normal with particular mean and var-cov matrix

```{r}
vcov( m4.1 )
```

-- We sample from the posterior by simulating many values from this normal distribution

## Using rethinking Package

```{r}
post <- extract.samples( m4.1, 1000)
head(post)
```

## Graph of the Posterior

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(post, aes(mu, sigma)) + geom_point()
```

## Can Perform Inference from Simulated Draws

### Testing problem

- What is the probability $mu$ is larger than 155 cm?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
summarize(post, Prob=mean(mu > 155))
```

## Inference from Simulating Draws

### Estimation problem

- 80 percent probability interval for $\sigma$

```{r}
summarize(post, LO = quantile(sigma, .1),
                HI = quantile(sigma, .9))
```

## Can Learn About Functions of the Parameters

- Suppose you are interested in coefficient of variation
$$
CV = \mu / \sigma
$$

- Simulate from posterior distribution of $CV$ by computing $CV$ for each simulated draw of $(\mu, \sigma)$

```{r}
post <- mutate(post, CV = mu / sigma)
```

- 80 percent interval estimate for $CV$

```{r}
summarize(post, LO = quantile(CV, .1),
                HI = quantile(CV, .9))
```

## Prediction

- Suppose we are interested in predicting the maximum height of a future sample of size 10 - $y_S$

- Interested in the (posterior) predictive density
$$
f(y_S) = \int f(y_S | \mu, \sigma) g(\mu, \sigma) d\mu d\sigma
$$

where $g(\mu, \sigma)$ represents my current beliefs about the parameters

## Simulating from the Predictive Density

- Can be difficult to directly compute $f(y_S)$

- Simulation from $f$ is straightforward:

1.  Simulate $(\mu, \sigma)$ from $g()$

2.  Using these simulated draws, simulate $y_S$ from $f(y_S, \mu, \sigma)$

(We have already done this earlier in this part)

## Simulation of Predictive Density

- This simulates one future sample of 10 and computes the maximum height

```{r}
one_sample <- function(j){
  pars <- post[j, ]
  ys <- rnorm(10, pars$mu, pars$sigma)
  max(ys)
}
```

- Repeat this for all 1000 posterior draws

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
MS <- map_dbl(1:1000, one_sample)
```

## Posterior Predictive Density of Max

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2.5}
dens(MS)
```

## Prediction Interval

- Construct a 80 percent prediction interval for $M$

```{r}
quantile(MS, c(.10, .90))
```

- Interval incorporates two types of uncertainty 

1. don't know values of parameters (inferential uncertainty)

2. don't know values of heights conditional on parameters (sampling uncertainty)


## Exercises

Suppose you are interested in estimating the mean number of traffic accidents $\mu$ in your home town.  We assume that the actual number of accidents $y$ has a Poisson distribution with mean $\mu$.

1.  Make a best guess at the value of $\mu$.

2.  Suppose you are very sure about your guess in part 1.  Construct a normal prior which reflects this belief.

3.  Suppose instead that the "best guess" in part 1 was likely inaccurate.  Construct a normal prior that reflects this belief.

4.  Suppose you collect the numbers of traffic accidents for 10 days in your home town -- call these numbers $y_1, ..., y_{10}$.  Write down the Bayesian model including the sampling distribution and the prior distribution from part 1.

5.  Write down the Bayesian model as a script using the `resampling` package language.

## Exercises (continued)

6.  Describe how you could summarize the posterior density for $\lambda$ and simulate 1000 draws from the posterior.

7.  Based on the simulated draws from the posterior, how can you construct a 90 percent interval estimate for $\lambda$?

8.  How will your Bayesian interval in part 7.  compare with a traditional 90% frequentist confidence interval?

9.  Suppose you want to predict the number of traffic accidents $y_N$ in a day next week.  Explain how you would produce a simulated sample from the predictive distribution of $y_N$.

10.  What is one advantage of a Bayesian approach over a frequentist approach for this particular problem?

## Exercises (Continued)

11.  I collected the numbers of traffic accidents in Lincoln, Nebraska for 10 summer days in 2016:

36, 26, 35, 31, 12, 14, 46, 19, 37, 28

--  Assuming Poisson sampling with a weakly-informative prior, find a 90% interval estimate for $\lambda$.

--  Find a 90% prediction interval for the number of traffic accidents in a future summer day in Lincoln.

-- Explain what each line of code is doing on the next page.
